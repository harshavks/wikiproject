Hi Team,

For Automation of installing wikimedia i used terraform tool to launch autoscaling,elb,vpc,rds.etc. I used a default region as eu-west-1. 

The prerequisites are listed below

1)Install terraform 
2) access and secret key
3) need to generate a key to connect to the remote instances.

Step1 Assign admin role to the EC2 instance where we installed terraform. (terraform version should be 0.12 version or above)

#terraform -v

Step2 Create a folder and clone the terraform code from github

#mkdir Wikiproject
#git clone https://github.com/harshavks/wikiproject.git

Step3 generate a key with name as mykeypair

#ssh-keygen -f mykeypair

Step4 Now initialize the terraform, this will download a required plugin

#terraform init

Step4 Execute a below command

#terraform plan   ( is to verify everything is working fine or not)
#terraform apply

Step4 copy the lb DNS name and paste it in browser then provide the details. Similarly get the rds details from rds.tf file. This will connect to the wikimedia.
